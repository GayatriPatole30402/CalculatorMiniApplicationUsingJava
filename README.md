MENU-DRIVEN Calculator Application (Mini Project)

This menu-driven Java-based Calculator Application is a mini project designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus. It uses a simple console interface, providing users with a clear menu to select operations. The application efficiently handles user inputs and errors like division by zero using exception handling.

Features:

Menu-driven interface for smooth user interaction.
Supports five arithmetic operations.
Exception handling for division by zero.
Organized structure with separate Controller (Calculator) and Client (CalculatorApplication) classes.

This project is a great demonstration of Java fundamentals, including OOP, exception handling, and interactive console programming.
